  abstract = {Previous molecular analysis of the Octopus Spring cyanobacterial mat
	revealed numerous genetically distinct 16S rRNA sequences from predominant
	Synechococcus populations distantly related to the readily cultivated
	unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus lividus. Patterns in genotype
	distribution relative to temperature and light conditions suggested
	that the organisms contributing these 16S rRNA sequences may fill
	distinct ecological niches. To test this hypothesis, Synechococcus
	isolates were cultivated using a dilution and filtration approach
	and then shown to be genetically relevant to natural mat populations
	by comparisons of similarities of 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S internal
	transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Most isolates were identical or
	nearly identical at both loci to predominant mat genotypes; others
	showed 1- to 2-nucleotide differences at the 16S rRNA locus and even
	greater difference in ITS sequences. Isolates with predominant mat
	genotypes had distinct temperature ranges and optima for growth that
	were consistent with their distributions in the mat. Isolates with
	genotypes not previously detected or known to be predominant in the
	mat exhibited temperature ranges and optima that were not representative
	of predominant mat populations and also grew more slowly. Temperature
	effects on photosynthesis did not reflect temperature relations for
	growth. However, the isolate with the highest temperature optimum
	and upper limit was capable of performing photosynthesis at a higher
	temperature than other isolates. Growth rate and photosynthetic responses
	provided evidence for light acclimation but evidence of, at best,
	only subtle light adaptation.},

  abstract = {The human plasma proteome holds the promise of a revolution in disease
	diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring provided that major challenges
	in proteomics and related disciplines can be addressed. Plasma is
	not only the primary clinical specimen but also represents the largest
	and deepest version of the human proteome present in any sample:
	in addition to the classical "plasma proteins," it contains all tissue
	proteins (as leakage markers) plus very numerous distinct immunoglobulin
	sequences, and it has an extraordinary dynamic range in that more
	than 10 orders of magnitude in concentration separate albumin and
	the rarest proteins now measured clinically. Although the restricted
	dynamic range of conventional proteomic technology (two-dimensional
	gels and mass spectrometry) has limited its contribution to the list
	of 289 proteins (tabulated here) that have been reported in plasma
	to date, very recent advances in multidimensional survey techniques
	promise at least double this number in the near future. Abundant
	scientific evidence, from proteomics and other disciplines, suggests
	that among these are proteins whose abundances and structures change
	in ways indicative of many, if not most, human diseases. Nevertheless,
	only a handful of proteins are currently used in routine clinical
	diagnosis, and the rate of introduction of new protein tests approved
	by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has paradoxically
	declined over the last decade to less than one new protein diagnostic
	marker per year. We speculate on the reasons behind this large discrepancy
	between the expectations arising from proteomics and the realities
	of clinical diagnostics and suggest approaches by which protein-disease
	associations may be more effectively translated into diagnostic tools
	in the future.},

  abstract = {Metagenomic studies characterize both the composition and diversity
	of uncultured viral and microbial communities. BLAST-based comparisons
	have typically been used for such analyses; however, sampling biases,
	high percentages of unknown sequences, and the use of arbitrary thresholds
	to find significant similarities can decrease the accuracy and validity
	of estimates. Here, we present Genome relative Abundance and Average
	Size (GAAS), a complete software package that provides improved estimates
	of community composition and average genome length for metagenomes
	in both textual and graphical formats. GAAS implements a novel methodology
	to control for sampling bias via length normalization, to adjust
	for multiple BLAST similarities by similarity weighting, and to select
	significant similarities using relative alignment lengths. In benchmark
	tests, the GAAS method was robust to both high percentages of unknown
	sequences and to variations in metagenomic sequence read lengths.
	Re-analysis of the Sargasso Sea virome using GAAS indicated that
	standard methodologies for metagenomic analysis may dramatically
	underestimate the abundance and importance of organisms with small
	genomes in environmental systems. Using GAAS, we conducted a meta-analysis
	of microbial and viral average genome lengths in over 150 metagenomes
	from four biomes to determine whether genome lengths vary consistently
	between and within biomes, and between microbial and viral communities
	from the same environment. Significant differences between biomes
	and within aquatic sub-biomes (oceans, hypersaline systems, freshwater,
	and microbialites) suggested that average genome length is a fundamental
	property of environments driven by factors at the sub-biome level.
	The behavior of paired viral and microbial metagenomes from the same
	environment indicated that microbial and viral average genome sizes
	are independent of each other, but indicative of community responses
	to stressors and environmental conditions.},

  title = {{L}imits of the natural environment in terms of p{H} and oxidation-reduction
	potentials},
  journal = {J. Geol.},
  year = {1960},
  volume = {68},
  pages = {243 -- 284},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {1. The electron and the proton content (measured as electrode potential
	[Eh] and pH) of an environ-
	
	ment characterize this environment in many ways. In this paper the
	electrode potential and the pH are
	
	used as empirical parameters rather than as electrochemical data capable
	of thermodynamic interpretation.
	
	From published and unpublished work by the authors and from the literature,
	more than 6,200 pairs of
	
	characteristics were gathered, covering most types of the aqueous
	environment as well as the potential
	
	milieu of the chief actors in these environments: algae and bacteria.
	
	2. It appears that the Eh-pH limits of biological systems and of the
	naturally occurring aqueous environ-
	
	ment almost coincide. This would indicate that there are few, if any,
	sterile terrestrial environments caused
	
	by limiting Eh-pH characteristics.
	
	3. As it seems unlikely that environments will be found outside the
	limits outlined in this paper, physico-
	
	chemical speculations on the sedimentary environment should be limited
	by this outline. Substances which
	
	do not occur (sulfuric acid, sulfide ion) should not be used in the
	electrochemical characterization of the
	
	environment.
	
	4. The biogenic master reaction in the environment, changing one or
	both characteristics (Eh-pH), is
	
	reductive photosynthesis by algae and by colored bacteria. A photosynthetic
	mass may raise the pH of a
	
	water to 9.4; and in the absence of bivalent cations, to 12.6.
	
	5. The intensity of sulfate reduction depends upon the sulfate content
	of the water and on the available
	
	hydrogen, in both organic and inorganic form. The iron concentration
	is also important, as iron is the princi-
	
	pal acceptor of the H2S formed. The highly reactive, black iron sulfides
	may be partly oxidized with the
	
	formation of the more stable pyrite and marcasite. The reduction of
	iron from ferric to ferrous state takes
	
	place even in surface soil.
	
	6. Denitrification, another biologically important reduction, may
	be of lesser geochemical influence.
	
	7. Oxidative reactions comprise, apart from nitrification, chiefly
	the oxidation of H2S and SH- to sulfur,
	
	thiosulfate, sulfite, hydrosulfite, sulfate, and hydrosulfate and
	the oxidation of ferrous and manganous
	
	compounds. In contrast with the reductions, these oxidations are only
	in part biological. The oxidation of
	
	pyrite may give rise to extremely low pH values. Heterotrophic oxidation
	(respiration) results in the con-
	
	version of organic matter into CO2and H20.
	
	8. Acid formation in peat bogs is caused largely by cation exchange
	on plant cell walls, chiefly, but not
	
	exclusively, on Sphagnum.
	
	9. In sediments the reaction between iron phosphate complexes and
	H2S may liberate the acid H2P04- ion.
	
	10. Certain environments are restricted, others cover almost the maximal
	area outlined in this paper.
	
	A progressive increase in the environmental range, arranged in a series,
	follows: rain water, mine water,
	
	peat bogs, sea water, rivers and lakes, marine sediments, and evaporites,
	while the geothermal environment
	
	shows the maximal area.
	
	11. The potential milieu of the green bacteria is highly restricted.
	Less restricted is the environment of
	
	the iron bacteria, followed by sulfate-reducing bacteria, purple bacteria,
	and denitrifying bacteria. Thio-
	
	bacteria have a very wide potential milieu, and algae are found literally
	everywhere.
	
	12. The Eh-pH characteristics are determined chiefly by photosynthesis,
	by respiration and by oxido-
	
	reductive changes in the iron and sulfur systems.},

	Cyanidiales, their population structure and their phylogenetic relationships.
	Here we used a taxonomically broadly sampled three-gene data set

	and suggest that these algae were ancestrally thermo-acidotolerant.
	We also used environmental polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
	rbcL gene to sample Cyanidiales biodiversity at five ecologically
	distinct sites at Pisciarelli in the Phlegrean Fields in Italy. This

  year = {2009},
  volume = {3},
  number = {75},
  abstract = {Background: Protein subcellular localization and differences in oxidation
	state between subcellular compartments are two well-studied features
	of the the cellular organization of S. cerevisiae (yeast). Theories
	about the origin of subcellular organization are assisted by computational
	models that can integrate data from observations of compositional
	and chemical properties of the system. Presentation and implications
	of the hypothesis: I adopt the hypothesis that the state of yeast
	subcellular organization is in a local energy minimum. This hypothesis
	implies that equilibrium thermodynamic models can yield predictions
	about the interdependence between populations of proteins and their
	subcellular chemical environments. Testing the hypothesis: Three
	types of tests are proposed. First, there should be correlations
	between modeled and observed oxidation states for different compartments.
	Second, there should be a correspondence between the energy requirements
	of protein formation and the order the appearance of organelles during
	cellular development. Third, there should be correlations between
	the predicted and observed relative abundances of interacting proteins
	within compartments. Results: The relative metastability fields of
	subcellular homologs of glutaredoxin and thioredoxin indicate a trend
	from less to more oxidizing as mitochondrion – cytoplasm – nucleus.
	Representing the overall amino acid compositions of proteins in 23
	different compartments each with a single reference model protein
	suggests that the formation reactions for proteins in the vacuole
	(in relatively oxidizing conditions), ER and early Golgi (in relatively
	reducing conditions) are relatively highly favored, while that for
	the microtubule is the most costly. The relative abundances of model
	proteins for each compartment inferred from experimental data were
	found in some cases to correlate with the predicted abundances, and
	both positive and negative correlations were found for some assemblages
	of proteins in known complexes. Conclusion: The results of these
	calculations and tests suggest that a tendency toward a metastable
	energy minimum could underlie some organizational links between the
	the chemical thermodynamic properties of proteins and subcellular
	chemical environments. Future models of this kind will benefit from
	consideration of additional thermodynamic variables together with
	more detailed subcellular observations.},

  abstract = {Background: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components
	is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive
	models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these
	models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in
	the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to
	measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced
	to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible. Results:
	Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage
	of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological
	sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and
	peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the
	cytosolic fraction of the Escherichia coli strain MC4100. A measure
	of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based
	on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account
	the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance
	are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured
	copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were
	those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins.
	Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding
	function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated
	with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular
	organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be
	the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins
	are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length,
	pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also
	find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally
	we observe a significant correlation between protein and mRNA abundance
	in E. coli cells. Conclusion: Abundance measurements for more than
	1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete
	study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant
	associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties
	and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and

	living at moderate and high temperatures (mesophiles and thermophiles,

	different amino acids at different temperatures due to their biochemical
	properties. If that were the case, comparisons of different pairs
	of mesophilic and thennophilic taxa would exhibit similar patterns
	of substitutional asymmetry. A previous comparison of mesophilic
	versus thermophilic Methanococcus with mesophilic versus thermophilic
	Bacillus revealed several pairs of amino acids for which one amino
	acid was favored in thermophilic Bacillus and the other was favored
	in thermophilic Methanococcus. Most of this could be explained by
	the higher G+C content of the DNA of thermophilic Bacillus, a phenomenon

	bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans and its thermophilic relative Thermus
	thermophilus, which are similar in G+C content. Of the 190 pairs
	of amino acids, 83 exhibited significant substitutional asymmetry,
	consistent with the pervasive effects of selection. Most of these

	in the direction predicted from the Methanococcus data, consistent

	of the amino acids. However, 12 pairs of amino acids exhibited asymmetry
	significantly different from and in the opposite direction of that
	found in the Methanococcus comparison, and 21 pairs of amino acids
	exhibited asymmetry that was significantly different from that found
	in the Bacillus comparison and could not be explained by the greater
	G+C content in thermophilic Bacillus. This suggests that selection
	due to universal biochemical properties of the amino acids and differences
	in G+C content are not the only causes of substitutional asymmetry

	These calculations involve quantifying the chemical affinity for

	compositions of mixtures in which oxidation-reduction reactions are
	inhibited. The oxidation-reduction reactions that depart from equilibrium
	in these systems provide energy for chemotrophic microbial metabolism.

	fluids. Below 200 degreesC, the partial pressures of CO2, H2S and

	Zeolites are expected to replace prelmite and epidote. Redox potential
	calculated on the assumption of equilibrium for the H+/H-2 redox
	couple decreases in dilute geothermal fluids with increasing temperature

	H2S, SO4 and H-2. It is, accordingly, concluded that an overall equilibrium
	among redox species has not been reached for dilute geothermal fluids

	fluids. The latter conclusion is based on limited database and should
	be treated with care. Since the various redox components are not

	cannot be characterised by a unique hydrogen fugacity, oxygen fagacity

  abstract = {The endolithic environment, the pore space of rocks, is a ubiquitous
	habitat for microorganisms on the Earth(1) and is an important target
	of the search for life elsewhere in the Solar System(2). Photosynthetic,
	endolithic microbial communities commonly inhabit the outer millimetres
	to centimetres of all rocks exposed to the Earth's surface. In the
	most extreme terrestrial climates, such as hot and cold deserts,
	endolithic microorganisms are often the main form of life(3-5). The
	endolithic microhabitat gives protection from intense solar radiation
	and desiccation, and it provides mineral nutrients, rock moisture
	and growth surfaces(4,5). Here we describe the discovery and identification
	of the constituents of an extremely acidic (pH 1) endolithic microbial
	community inhabiting the pore space of rocks in the geothermal environment
	of Yellowstone National Park, USA. Subjected to silica mineralization,
	such endolithic communities constitute biomarkers that can become
	fossilized and potentially preserved in the geological record. Remnants
	of these communities could serve as biosignatures and provide important
	clues about ancient life associated with geothermal environments
	on the Earth or elsewhere in the Solar System.},

	‘‘Assembling the Tree of Life’’ project, we determined the
	genome sequence of Thermomicrobium roseum DSM 5159. T. roseum DSM
	5159 is a red-pigmented, rod-shaped, Gram-negative extreme thermophile
	isolated from a hot spring that possesses both an atypical cell wall
	composition and an unusual cell membrane that is composed entirely
	of long-chain 1,2- diols. Its genome is composed of two circular
	DNA elements, one of 2,006,217 bp (referred to as the chromosome)
	and one of 919,596 bp (referred to as the megaplasmid). Strikingly,
	though few standard housekeeping genes are found on the megaplasmid,
	it does encode a complete system for chemotaxis including both chemosensory
	components and an entire flagellar apparatus. This is the first known
	example of a complete flagellar system being encoded on a plasmid
	and suggests a straightforward means for lateral transfer of flagellum-based
	motility. Phylogenomic analyses support the recent rRNAbased analyses
	that led to T. roseum being removed from the phylum Thermomicrobia
	and assigned to the phylum Chloroflexi. Because T. roseum is a deep-branching
	member of this phylum, analysis of its genome provides insights into
	the evolution of the Chloroflexi. In addition, even though this species
	is not photosynthetic, analysis of the genome provides some insight
	into the origins of photosynthesis in the Chloroflexi. Metabolic
	pathway reconstructions and experimental studies revealed new aspects
	of the biology of this species. For example, we present evidence
	that T. roseum oxidizes CO aerobically, making it the first thermophile
	known to do so. In addition, we propose that glycosylation of its
	carotenoids plays a crucial role in the adaptation of the cell membrane
	to this bacterium’s thermophilic lifestyle. Analyses of published
	metagenomic sequences from two hot springs similar to the one from
	which this strain was isolated, show that close relatives of T. roseum
	DSM 5159 are present but have some key differences from the strain
	sequenced.},
