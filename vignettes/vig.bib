  Abstract                 = {Group additivity equations of state for aqueous organic molecules have been generated by combining the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers (HKF) equations of state (Shock and Helgeson, 1988, 1990; Tanger and Helgeson, 1988; Shock et al., 1989, 1992) with experimental values of the standard molal properties of aqueous alkanes, alkanols, alkylbenzenes, carboxylic acids, amides, and amines. Equations of state parameters for the groups represented by -cn2 , -CH3, -CHCH3-, -C6H5, -CH2OH, -COOH, -CONH2, and -CH2NH2 were determined by regression of the experimental data. This procedure permits calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of these groups at elevated tempera-tures and pressures. Although curves representing the apparent standard molal Gibbs free energies ( A G °) and enthalpies ( A H °) of formation, and the standard molal entropies (S °) of the groups as a function of temperature and pressure are respectively similar for each of them, the temperature dependence of the standard molal heat capacities (C~) and volumes (V°) of a number of the groups are quite different from one another. For example, the standard molal heat capacities of the hydrocarbon groups minimize with increasing temperature, but those of -CHEOH and -CH2NH2 maximize. Computed values of AG °, A H °, S °, C~, V °, and the equations of state parameters for the various groups were used together with group additivity relations to generate corresponding values of these properties for aqueous n-alkanes, 2-methylalkanes, n-alkylbenzenes, n-alkanols, n-carboxylic acids, n-amides, and n-amines at temperatures -< 250°C and pressures - 1 kbar. The validity and generality of the equations of state are supported by the fact that predicted equilibrium constants for liquid n-alkane solubility reactions in water compare favorably with experimental values reported in the literature for temperatures as high as 200°C. Furthermore, equilibrium constants for aqueous ethane coexisting with ethene at 325 and 350°C at 350 bars predicted from the equations of state are in close agreement with independently determined experimental values reported by Seewald (1994). The standard molal thermodynamic properties and equations of state parameters reported below provide the means to characterize the thermodynamic behavior of a wide variety of aqueous organic species involved in hydrothermal reactions at elevated temperatures and pressures.},

  Abstract                 = {The fugacity was introduced by G.N. Lewis in 1901, and became widely used after the appearance of Thermodynamics, a very influential textbook by Lewis and Randall in 1923. Lewis describes the need for such a function in terms of an analogy with temperature in the attainment of equilibrium between phases. Just as equilibrium requires that heat must flow such that temperature is the same in all parts of the system, so matter must flow such that chemical potentials are also equalized. He referred to the flow of matter from one phase to another as an ?escaping tendency,? such as a liquid escaping to the gas form to achieve an equilibrium vapor pressure. He pointed out that in fact vapor pressure is equilibrated between phases under many conditions (and in fact is the basis for the isopiestic method of activity determinations, §5.8.4), and could serve as a good measure of escaping tendency if it behaved always as an ideal gas.},

  Abstract                 = {The human plasma proteome holds the promise of a revolution in disease diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring provided that major challenges in proteomics and related disciplines can be addressed. Plasma is not only the primary clinical specimen but also represents the largest and deepest version of the human proteome present in any sample: in addition to the classical "plasma proteins," it contains all tissue proteins (as leakage markers) plus very numerous distinct immunoglobulin sequences, and it has an extraordinary dynamic range in that more than 10 orders of magnitude in concentration separate albumin and the rarest proteins now measured clinically. Although the restricted dynamic range of conventional proteomic technology (two-dimensional gels and mass spectrometry) has limited its contribution to the list of 289 proteins (tabulated here) that have been reported in plasma to date, very recent advances in multidimensional survey techniques promise at least double this number in the near future. Abundant scientific evidence, from proteomics and other disciplines, suggests that among these are proteins whose abundances and structures change in ways indicative of many, if not most, human diseases. Nevertheless, only a handful of proteins are currently used in routine clinical diagnosis, and the rate of introduction of new protein tests approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has paradoxically declined over the last decade to less than one new protein diagnostic marker per year. We speculate on the reasons behind this large discrepancy between the expectations arising from proteomics and the realities of clinical diagnostics and suggest approaches by which protein-disease associations may be more effectively translated into diagnostic tools in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Metagenomic studies characterize both the composition and diversity of uncultured viral and microbial communities. BLAST-based comparisons have typically been used for such analyses; however, sampling biases, high percentages of unknown sequences, and the use of arbitrary thresholds to find significant similarities can decrease the accuracy and validity of estimates. Here, we present Genome relative Abundance and Average Size (GAAS), a complete software package that provides improved estimates of community composition and average genome length for metagenomes in both textual and graphical formats. GAAS implements a novel methodology to control for sampling bias via length normalization, to adjust for multiple BLAST similarities by similarity weighting, and to select significant similarities using relative alignment lengths. In benchmark tests, the GAAS method was robust to both high percentages of unknown sequences and to variations in metagenomic sequence read lengths. Re-analysis of the Sargasso Sea virome using GAAS indicated that standard methodologies for metagenomic analysis may dramatically underestimate the abundance and importance of organisms with small genomes in environmental systems. Using GAAS, we conducted a meta-analysis of microbial and viral average genome lengths in over 150 metagenomes from four biomes to determine whether genome lengths vary consistently between and within biomes, and between microbial and viral communities from the same environment. Significant differences between biomes and within aquatic sub-biomes (oceans, hypersaline systems, freshwater, and microbialites) suggested that average genome length is a fundamental property of environments driven by factors at the sub-biome level. The behavior of paired viral and microbial metagenomes from the same environment indicated that microbial and viral average genome sizes are independent of each other, but indicative of community responses to stressors and environmental conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The electron and the proton content (measured as electrode potential [Eh] and pH) of an environment characterize this environment in many ways. In this paper the electrode potential and the pH are used as empirical parameters rather than as electrochemical data capable of thermodynamic interpretation. From published and unpublished work by the authors and from the literature, more than 6,200 pairs of characteristics were gathered, covering most types of the aqueous environment as well as the potential milieu of the chief actors in these environments: algae and bacteria. It appears that the Eh-pH limits of biological systems and of the naturally occurring aqueous environment almost coincide. This would indicate that there are few, if any, sterile terrestrial environments caused by limiting Eh-pH characteristics. As it seems unlikely that environments will be found outside the limits outlined in this paper, physico-chemical speculations on the sedimentary environment should be limited by this outline. Substances which do not occur (sulfuric acid, sulfide ion) should not be used in the electrochemical characterization of the environment. The biogenic master reaction in the environment, changing one or both characteristics (Eh-pH), is reductive photosynthesis by algae and by colored bacteria. A photosynthetic mass may raise the pH of a water to 9.4; and in the absence of bivalent cations, to 12.6. The intensity of sulfate reduction depends upon the sulfate content of the water and on the available hydrogen, in both organic and inorganic form. The iron concentration is also important, as iron is the principal acceptor of the H2S formed. The highly reactive, black iron sulfides may be partly oxidized with the formation of the more stable pyrite and marcasite. The reduction of iron from ferric to ferrous state takes place even in surface soil. Denitrification, another biologically important reduction, may be of lesser geochemical influence. Oxidative reactions comprise, apart from nitrification, chiefly the oxidation of H2S and SH- to sulfur, thiosulfate, sulfite, hydrosulfite, sulfate, and hydrosulfate and the oxidation of ferrous and manganous compounds. In contrast with the reductions, these oxidations are only in part biological. The oxidation of pyrite may give rise to extremely low pH values. Heterotrophic oxidation (respiration) results in the conversion of organic matter into CO2 and H2O. Acid formation in peat bogs is caused largely by cation exchange on plant cell walls, chiefly, but not exclusively, on Sphagnum. In sediments the reaction between iron phosphate complexes and H2S may liberate the acid H2P04- ion. 10. Certain environments are restricted, others cover almost the maximal area outlined in this paper. A progressive increase in the environmental range, arranged in a series, follows: rain water, mine water, peat bogs, sea water, rivers and lakes, marine sediments, and evaporites, while the geothermal environment shows the maximal area. The potential milieu of the green bacteria is highly restricted. Less restricted is the environment of the iron bacteria, followed by sulfate-reducing bacteria, purple bacteria, and denitrifying bacteria. Thio-bacteria have a very wide potential milieu, and algae are found literally everywhere. The Eh-pH characteristics are determined chiefly by photosynthesis, by respiration and by oxido-reductive changes in the iron and sulfur systems.},

  Abstract                 = {A general limiting law is proposed which can be used to systematize the various laws of additivity of molecularproperties. This can be stated asfollows: Ii I! is a molecularproperty, then for the disproportionation reaction: RNR+SNSz:;>2RNS, A<I1*> as ! the separation between R and S becomes large compared to their dimensions. It is shown that the zero-orderapproximation is equivalent to the law of additivity of atomic properties, the first-order approximation to the law oi additivity of bond properties, the second-orderapproximation to the law of additivity of group properties, and so forth. It is shown that for Cpand5° idealgases!, the additivity oi atomic properties works to about 3:2 cal/mole-°K, while the additivity of bond properties is usually good to about ;l;1 cal/mole-°K. The latter alsoestimates AH;° to about :l:3 kcal/ mole. T he group additivity relation is generally obeyed to within :l:O.5cal/mole-K for C Pand S° and about $0.6 kcalf mole for AH;°. Tablesare presentedfor each of the partial properties at 25°C. The agreements found for the various additivity rules is examined from a molecular point of view and certain extensions and limitations indicated. The application and utility of the rules in estimation of thermodynamic properties is discussed. The estimation of bond dissociation energies is possible with the additivity rules as are the thermodynamic properties of free radicals. An application of the rules to species NR2 and NS2 show that R and S may be ordered according to their general bond-weakening or bond-strengthening properties. For systems where N is C2H4 it is shown that the first and second bond dissociation energies for RC2H4R is very likely a constant=59.5 kcal, the excitation energy of C2H4.},

Theories about the origin of subcellular organization are assisted by computational models that can integrate data from observations of compositional and chemical properties of the system. Presentation and implications of the hypothesis: I adopt the hypothesis that the state of yeast subcellular organization is in a local energy minimum. This hypothesis implies that equilibrium thermodynamic models can yield predictions about the interdependence between populations of proteins and their subcellular chemical environments. Testing the hypothesis: Three types of tests are proposed. First, there should be correlations between modeled and observed oxidation states for different compartments. Second, there should be a correspondence between the energy requirements of protein formation and the order the appearance of organelles during cellular development. Third, there should be correlations between the predicted and observed relative abundances of interacting proteins within compartments. Results: The relative metastability fields of subcellular homologs of glutaredoxin and thioredoxin indicate a trend from less to more oxidizing as mitochondrion â cytoplasm â nucleus. Representing the overall amino acid compositions of proteins in 23 different compartments each with a single reference model protein suggests that the formation reactions for proteins in the vacuole (in relatively oxidizing conditions), ER and early Golgi (in relatively reducing conditions) are relatively highly favored, while that for the microtubule is the most costly. The relative abundances of model proteins for each compartment inferred from experimental data were found in some cases to correlate with the predicted abundances, and both positive and negative correlations were found for some assemblages of proteins in known complexes. Conclusion: The results of these calculations and tests suggest that a tendency toward a metastable energy minimum could underlie some organizational links between the the chemical thermodynamic properties of proteins and subcellular chemical environments. Future models of this kind will benefit from consideration of additional thermodynamic variables together with more detailed subcellular observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Proteins of various compositions are required by organisms inhabiting different environments. The energetic demands for protein formation are a function of the compositions of proteins as well as geochemical variables including temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity and pH. The purpose of this study was to explore the dependence of metastable equilibrium states of protein systems on changes in the geochemical variables. Results: A software package called CHNOSZ implementing the revised Helgeson-Kirkham- Flowers (HKF) equations of state and group additivity for ionized unfolded aqueous proteins was developed. The program can be used to calculate standard molal Gibbs energies and other thermodynamic properties of reactions and to make chemical speciation and predominance diagrams that represent the metastable equilibrium distributions of proteins. The approach takes account of the chemical affinities of reactions in open systems characterized by the chemical potentials of basis species. The thermodynamic database included with the package permits application of the software to mineral and other inorganic systems as well as systems of proteins or other biomolecules. Conclusion: Metastable equilibrium activity diagrams were generated for model cell-surface proteins from archaea and bacteria adapted to growth in environments that differ in temperature and chemical conditions. The predicted metastable equilibrium distributions of the proteins can be compared with the optimal growth temperatures of the organisms and with geochemical variables. The results suggest that a thermodynamic assessment of protein metastability may be useful for integrating bio- and geochemical observations.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermodynamic calculations can be used to quantify environmental constraints on the speciation of proteins, such as the pH and temperature dependence of ionization state, and the relative chemical stabilities of proteins in different biogeochemical settings. These calculations depend in part on values of the standard molal Gibbs energies of proteins and their ionization reactions as a function of temperature and pressure. Because these values are not generally available, we calculated values of the standard molal thermodynamic properties at 25 degrees C and 1 bar as well as the revised Helgeson- Kirkham- Flowers equations of state parameters of neutral and charged zwitterionic reference model compounds including aqueous amino acids, polypeptides, and unfolded proteins. The experimental calorimetric and volumetric data for these species taken from the literature were combined with group additivity algorithms to calculate the properties and parameters of neutral and ionized sidechain and backbone groups in unfolded proteins. The resulting set of group contributions enables the calculation of the standard molal Gibbs energy, enthalpy, entropy, isobaric heat capacity, volume, and isothermal compressibility of unfolded proteins in a range of proton ionization states to temperatures and pressures exceeding 100 degrees C and 1000 bar. This approach provides a useful frame of reference for thermodynamic studies of protein folding and complexation reactions. It can also be used to assign provisional values of the net charge and Gibbs energy of ionized proteins as a function of temperature and pH. Using these values, an Eh-pH diagram for a reaction representing the speciation of extracellular proteins from Pyrococcus furiosus and Bacillus subtilis was generated. The predicted predominance limits of these proteins correspond with the different electrochemical conditions of hydrothermal vents and soils. More comprehensive calculations of this kind may reveal pervasive chemical potential constraints on the interactions of microbes with their environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Many studies link the compositions of microbial communities to their environments, but the energetics of organism-specific biomass synthesis as a function of geochemical variables have rarely been assessed. We describe a thermodynamic model that integrates geochemical and metagenomic data for biofilms sampled at five sites along a thermal and chemical gradient in the outflow channel of the hot spring known as "Bison Pool" in Yellowstone National Park. The relative abundances of major phyla in individual communities sampled along the outflow channel are modeled by computing metastable equilibrium between model proteins with amino acid compositions derived from metagenomic sequences. Geochemical conditions are represented by temperature and activities of basis species, including pH and oxidation-reduction potential quantified as the activity of dissolved hydrogen. By adjusting the activity of hydrogen, the model can be tuned to closely approximate the relative abundances of the phyla observed in the community profiles generated from BLAST assignments. The findings reveal an inverse relationship between the energy demand to form the proteins at equal thermodynamic activities and the abundance of phyla in the community. The distance from metastable equilibrium of the communities, assessed using an equation derived from energetic considerations that is also consistent with the information-theoretic entropy change, decreases along the outflow channel. Specific divergences from metastable equilibrium, such as an underprediction of the relative abundances of phototrophic organisms at lower temperatures, can be explained by considering additional sources of energy and/or differences in growth efficiency. Although the metabolisms used by many members of these communities are driven by chemical disequilibria, the results support the possibility that higher-level patterns of chemotrophic microbial ecosystems are shaped by metastable equilibrium states that depend on both the composition of biomass and the environmental conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncovering the chemical and physical links between natural environments and microbial communities is becoming increasingly amenable owing to geochemical observations and metagenomic sequencing. At the hot spring known as Bison Pool in Yellowstone National Park, the cooling of the water in the outflow channel is associated with an increase in oxidation potential estimated from multiple field-based measurements. Representative groups of proteins whose sequences were derived from metagenomic data also exhibit an increase in average oxidation state of carbon in the protein molecules with distance from the hot-spring source. The energetic requirements of reactions to form selected proteins used in the model were computed using amino-acid group additivity for the standard molal thermodynamic properties of the proteins, and the relative chemical stabilities of the proteins were investigated by varying temperature, pH and oxidation state, expressed as activity of dissolved hydrogen. The relative stabilities of the proteins were found to track the locations of the sampling sites when the calculations included a function for hydrogen activity that increases with temperature and is higher, or more reducing, than values consistent with measurements of dissolved oxygen, sulfide and oxidation-reduction potential in the field. These findings imply that spatial patterns in the amino acid compositions of proteins can be linked, through energetics of overall chemical reactions representing the formation of the proteins, to the environmental conditions at this hot spring, even if microbial cells maintain considerably different internal conditions. Further applications of the thermodynamic calculations are possible for other natural microbial ecosystems.},

Molar volumes and molar heat capacities of the pure alkanols (except for 2-methyl-2-propanol and 2,2-dimethyl-1-propanol, which are solid at 298.15 K) were determined using the same instrumentation.

These values, combined with the respective pure liquid properties, produced the limiting partial molar excess quantities ((V) over bar (E,infinity)(m,1), (C) over bar (E,infinity)(p,m,1)).

Here, we resurrect candidate sequences for elongation factors of the Tu family (EF-Tu) found at ancient nodes in the bacterial evolutionary tree, and measure their activities as a function of temperature. The ancient EF-Tu proteins have temperature optima of 55-65degreesC. This value seems to be robust with respect to uncertainties in the ancestral reconstruction. This suggests that the ancient bacteria that hosted these particular genes were thermophiles, and neither hyperthermophiles nor mesophiles. This conclusion can be compared and contrasted with inferences drawn from an analysis of the lengths of branches in trees joining proteins from contemporary bacteria(10), the distribution of thermophily in derived bacterial lineages(11), the inferred G+C content of ancient ribosomal RNA(12), and the geological record combined with assumptions concerning molecular clocks(13).

Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins-and the ubiquitous occurrence of posttranscriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible. Results: Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the cytosolic fraction of the Escherichia coli strain MC4100. A measure of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins. Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length, pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally we observe a significant correlation between protein and mRNA abundance in E. coli cells. Conclusion: Abundance measurements for more than 1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and novel insights into the role of protein concentration in this model organism.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in theoretical geochemistry permit calculation of the standard molal thermodynamic properties of a wide variety of minerals, gases, aqueous species, and reactions from 1 to 5000 bar and 0 to 1000 C. The SUPCRT92 software package facilitates practical application of these recent theories, equations, and data to define equilibrium constraints on geochemical processes in a wide variety of geologic systems. The SUPCRT92 package is composed of three interactive FORTRAN 77 programs, SUPCRT92, MPRONS92, and CPRONS92, and a sequential-access thermodynamic database, SPRONS92.DAT. The SUPCRT92 program reads or permits user-generation of its two input files, CON and RXN, retrieves data from the direct-access equivalent of SPRONS92.DAT, calculates the standard molal Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, heat capacity, and volume of each reaction specified on the RXN file through a range of conditions specified on the CON file, and writes the calculated reaction properties to the output TAB file and, optionally, to PLT files that facilitate their graphical depiction. Calculations can be performed along the liquid side of the H20 vaporization boundary by specifying either temperature (T) or pressure (P), and in the single-phase regions of fluid H2O by specifying either T and P, T and H20 density, T and log K, or P and log K. SPRONS92.DAT, which contains standard molal thermodynamic properties at 25 C and 1 bar, equation-of-state parameters, heat capacity coefficients,and phase transition data for approximately 500 minerals, gases, and aqueous species, can be augmented or otherwise modified using MPRONS92, and converted to its direct-access equivalent using CPRONS92.},

  Abstract                 = {To augment the relatively sparse set of thermodynamic data available for high molecular weight biopolymers, group additivity algorithms have been developed to estimate the heat capacity power function coe?cients and standard molal thermodynamic properties of crystalline peptides in the multitude of biogeochemical environments in which they are found. Group contributions representing the 20 common amino acids plus 5-hydroxylysine and 4-hydroxyproline for each coe?cient and property were generated using the thermodynamic properties of crystalline amino acids, polypeptides and other organic compounds. These group contributions were in turn used to compute the thermodynamic properties of naturally occurring proteins that are found in a crystalline state in cells. The coefficients and properties of the model compounds, group contributions and proteins are tabulated. In a demonstration of the uncertainty of the thermodynamic properties of the groups generated in this study, experimentally determined heat capacities and entropies of crystalline homopolypeptides and proteins taken from the literature have been compared to estimates of these quantities. Additionally, standard molal volumes for 24 amino acids have been recalculated in light of inconsistencies in an earlier analysis, and the standard molal thermodynamic properties of aqueous and crystalline methionine at 25 C and 0.1 MPa have been reassessed. Calculations of this kind can be carried out to thermodynamically describe the biogeochemical interactions throughout the broad range of environmental settings in which they are known to occur.},

  Abstract                 = {In Yellowstone National Park, a small percentage of thermal features support streamer biofilm communities (SBCs), but their growth criteria are poorly understood. This study investigates biofilms in two SBC hosting, and two non-SBC springs. Sequencing of 16S rRNA clones indicates changing community structure as a function of downstream geochemistry, with many novel representatives particularly among the Crenarchaeota. While some taxonomic groups show little genetic variation, others show specialization by sample location. The transition fringe environment between the hotter chemosynthetic and cooler photosynthetic zones hosts a larger diversity of organisms in SBC bearing springs. This transition is proposed to represent an ecotone; this is the first description of an ecotone in a hydrothermal environment. The Aquificales are ubiquitous and dominate among the Bacteria in the hottest environments. However, there is no difference in species of Aquificales from SBC and non-SBC locations, suggesting they are not responsible for the formation of SBCs, or that their role in SBC formation is competitively suppressed in non-SBC sites. In addition, only SBC locations support Thermotogales-like organisms, highlighting the potential importance these organisms may have in SBC formation. Here, we present a novel view of SBC formation and variability in hydrothermal ecosystems.},

Commonly, the first concern of solution chemists and aqueous geochemists is to calculate the distribution and activities of species on the assumption that equilibrium exists throughout the aqueous phase. Species distribution can then be used in several areas of analytical and applied chemistry, e.g. to examine the availability of free and reactive ions, to test solubility hypotheses, and to determine the potential bioavailability of nutrients or toxic substances. Species distribution also forms the basis for more complex computations involving solutions which change composition by reaction with other solutions and with gases and solids. Equilibrium calculations of this type are particularly helpful in solving interpretive problems encountered in such fields as chemical and environmental engineering, geochemistry, biochemistry and aquatic ecology.},

Although there is an overwhelming thermodynamic drive to form biomolecules by the Strecker synthesis at hydrothermal conditions, the availability and concentration of starting compounds limit the efficiency and productivity of Strecker reactions. Mechanisms for concentrating reactant compounds could help overcome this problem, but other mechanisms for production of biomolecules may have been required to produce the required compounds on the early Earth.

To evaluate factors that regulate the stability of ethane, ethene, propane, and propene in hydrothermal systems a series of experiments were conducted at 300 to 325 C and 350 bars. The experiments contained the mineral assemblages pyrite-pyrrhotite-magnetite, hematite-magnetite-pyrite, and hematite-magnetite to buffer f O2, almaq) and aH2S(aq) at geologically reasonable values. Results of the experiments suggest that under appropriate physical and chemical conditions, metastable redox dependent thermodynamic equilibrium involving liquid water and inorganic iron-bearing mineral assemblages may regulate the relative abundance of short chain alkanes and their corresponding alkenes. In addition, alkenes represent an important intermediary in the conversion of n-alkanes to methane and oxidized species such as carbon dioxide, ketones alcohols, and organic acids. The rates of redox dependent organic reactions during the experiments were strongly influenced by the presence of sulfur. Under relatively oxidizing conditions greater catalytic activity due to the presence of dissolved sulfur species was observed. Fluid speciation calculations suggest that oxidized aquous sulfur compotmds represent the catalytically active species. These results suggest that redox conditions and the presence or absence of dissolved sulfur species in natural sedimentary enviromnents may strongly influence the stability of hydrocarbons. Accordingly, models used to predict the stability of oil and the formations of natural gas need to account for chemical processes that involve both organic and inorganic sedimentary components.},

These calculations involve quantifying the chemical affinity for individual reactions by comparing equilibrium compositions with the compositions of mixtures in which oxidation-reduction reactions are inhibited. The oxidation-reduction reactions that depart from equilibrium in these systems provide energy for chemotrophic microbial metabolism. Methanogenesis is an example of this phenomenon, in which the combination of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane induced by fluid mixing is far from equilibrium, which can be approached if more methane is generated. Similarly, the production of other organic compounds is also favorable under the same conditions that permit methanogenesis. Alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and amino acids are among the compounds that, if formed, would lower the energetic state of the chemical composition generated in mixed fluids. The resulting positive values of chemical affinity correspond to the thermodynamic drive required for abiotic organic synthesis. It is also possible that energy release accompanies biosynthesis by chemotrophic organisms. In this way, hydrothermal ecosystems differ radically from familiar ecosystems at Earth's surface. If captured, the energy released may be sufficient to drive biosynthesis of carbohydrates, purines, pyrimidines and other compounds which require energy inputs.},

We studied the phylogenetic compositions of high-temperature (> 70degreesC) communities in Yellowstone hot springs with distinct chemistries, conducted parallel chemical analyses, and carried out thermodynamic modeling. Results of extensive molecular analyses, taken with previous results, show that most microbial biomass in these systems, as reflected by rRNA gene abundance, is comprised of organisms of the kinds that derive energy for primary productivity from the oxidation of molecular hydrogen, H-2. The apparent dominance by H-2-metabolizing organisms indicates that H-2 is the main source of energy for primary production in the Yellowstone high-temperature ecosystem. Hydrogen concentrations in the hot springs were measured and found to range up to >300 nM, consistent with this hypothesis. Thermodynamic modeling with environmental concentrations of potential energy sources also is consistent with the proposed microaerophilic, hydrogen-based energy economy for this geothermal ecosystem, even in the presence of high concentrations of sulfide.},

  Abstract                 = {The gas and redox chemistry of 100-300 degreesC geothermal fluids in Iceland has been studied as a function of fluid temperature and fluid composition. The partial pressures of CO2 in dilute (mCl < 500 ppm) and saline (mCl > 500 ppm) geothermal fluids above 200 degreesC are controlled by the mineral buffer clinozoisite + prelmite + calcite + quartz. Two buffers are considered to control the H2S and H-2 partial pressures above 200 degreesC depending on fluid salinity, epidote + prehnite + pyrite + pyrrhotite for dilute fluids and pyrite + prehnite + quartz + magnetite + anhydrite + clinozoisite + quartz for saline fluids. Below 200 degreesC, the partial pressures of CO2, H2S and H-2 also seem to be buffered but other minerals must be involved. Zeolites are expected to replace prelmite and epidote. Redox potential calculated on the assumption of equilibrium for the H+/H-2 redox couple decreases in dilute geothermal fluids with increasing temperature from about - 0.5 V at 100 degreesC to - 0.8 V at 300 degreesC, whereas saline geothermal fluids at 250 degreesC display a redox potential of about - 0.45 V. A systematic discrepancy between redox couples of about 0.05-0.09 V is observed in the redox potential for the dilute geothermal fluids, whereas redox potentials agree within 0.02-0.04 V for saline geothermal waters. The discrepancies in the calculated redox potential for dilute geothermal fluids are thought to be due to a general lack of equilibrium between CH4, CO2 and H-2 and between H2S, SO4 and H-2. It is, accordingly, concluded that an overall equilibrium among redox species has not been reached for dilute geothermal fluids whereas it appears to be more closely approached for the saline geothermal fluids. The latter conclusion is based on limited database and should be treated with care. Since the various redox components are not in an overall equilibrium in geothermal fluids in Iceland these fluids cannot be characterised by a unique hydrogen fugacity, oxygen fagacity or redox potential at a given temperature and pressure.

The general method, which is based on the minimization of free energy, states the problem with unusual simplicity, avoiding many of the usual difficulties of description and computation. Two specific computation procedures are shown, one using a steepest descent technique applied to a quadratic fit, the other making use of linear programing.},

  Abstract                 = {EQ3/6 is a software package for modeling chemical and mineralogic interactions in aqueous geochemical systems. The major components of the package are EQ3NR (a speciation-solubility code), EQ6 (a reaction path code), EQLIB (a supporting library), and a supporting thermodynamic data base. EQ3NR calculates aqueous speciation and saturation indices from analytical data. It can also be used to calculate compositions of buffer solutions for use in laboratory experiments. EQ6 computes reaction path models of both equilibrium step processes and kinetic reaction processes. These models can be computed for closed systems and relatively simple open systems. EQ3/6 is useful in making purely theoretical calculations, in designing, interpreting, and extrapolating laboratory experiments, and in testing and developing submodels and supporting data used in these codes. The thermodynamic data base supports calculations over the range 0-300°C.},
