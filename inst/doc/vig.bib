  abstract = {Previous molecular analysis of the Octopus Spring cyanobacterial mat
	revealed numerous genetically distinct 16S rRNA sequences from predominant
	Synechococcus populations distantly related to the readily cultivated
	unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus lividus. Patterns in genotype
	distribution relative to temperature and light conditions suggested
	that the organisms contributing these 16S rRNA sequences may fill
	distinct ecological niches. To test this hypothesis, Synechococcus
	isolates were cultivated using a dilution and filtration approach
	and then shown to be genetically relevant to natural mat populations
	by comparisons of similarities of 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S internal
	transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Most isolates were identical or
	nearly identical at both loci to predominant mat genotypes; others
	showed 1- to 2-nucleotide differences at the 16S rRNA locus and even
	greater difference in ITS sequences. Isolates with predominant mat
	genotypes had distinct temperature ranges and optima for growth that
	were consistent with their distributions in the mat. Isolates with
	genotypes not previously detected or known to be predominant in the
	mat exhibited temperature ranges and optima that were not representative
	of predominant mat populations and also grew more slowly. Temperature
	effects on photosynthesis did not reflect temperature relations for
	growth. However, the isolate with the highest temperature optimum
	and upper limit was capable of performing photosynthesis at a higher
	temperature than other isolates. Growth rate and photosynthetic responses
	provided evidence for light acclimation but evidence of, at best,
	only subtle light adaptation.},

	diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring provided that major challenges
	in proteomics and related disciplines can be addressed. Plasma is
	not only the primary clinical specimen but also represents the largest
	and deepest version of the human proteome present in any sample:
	in addition to the classical "plasma proteins," it contains all tissue
	proteins (as leakage markers) plus very numerous distinct immunoglobulin
	sequences, and it has an extraordinary dynamic range in that more
	than 10 orders of magnitude in concentration separate albumin and
	the rarest proteins now measured clinically. Although the restricted
	dynamic range of conventional proteomic technology (two-dimensional
	gels and mass spectrometry) has limited its contribution to the list
	of 289 proteins (tabulated here) that have been reported in plasma
	to date, very recent advances in multidimensional survey techniques
	promise at least double this number in the near future. Abundant
	scientific evidence, from proteomics and other disciplines, suggests
	that among these are proteins whose abundances and structures change
	in ways indicative of many, if not most, human diseases. Nevertheless,
	only a handful of proteins are currently used in routine clinical
	diagnosis, and the rate of introduction of new protein tests approved
	by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has paradoxically
	declined over the last decade to less than one new protein diagnostic
	marker per year. We speculate on the reasons behind this large discrepancy
	between the expectations arising from proteomics and the realities
	of clinical diagnostics and suggest approaches by which protein-disease
	associations may be more effectively translated into diagnostic tools

	These unicellular taxa have a relatively simple morphology and are
	currently classified into three genera, Cyanidium, Cyanidioschyzon
	and Galdieria. Little is known, however, about the biodiversity of
	Cyanidiales, their population structure and their phylogenetic relationships.
	Here we used a taxonomically broadly sampled three-gene data set
	of plastid sequences to infer a robust phylogenetic framework for
	the Cyanidiales. The phylogenetic analyses support the existence
	of at least four distinct Cyanidiales lineages: the Galdieria spp.
	lineage (excluding Galdieria maxima), the Cyanidium caldarium lineage,
	a novel monophyletic lineage of mesophilic Cyanidium spp. and the
	Cyanidioschyzon merolae plus Galdieria maxima lineage. Our analyses
	do not support the notion of a mesophilic ancestry of the Cyanidiales
	and suggest that these algae were ancestrally thermo-acidotolerant.
	We also used environmental polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
	rbcL gene to sample Cyanidiales biodiversity at five ecologically
	distinct sites at Pisciarelli in the Phlegrean Fields in Italy. This
	analysis showed a high level of sequence divergence among Cyanidiales
	species and the partitioning of taxa based on environmental conditions.
	Our research revealed an unexpected level of genetic diversity among
	Cyanidiales that revises current thinking about the phylogeny and
	biodiversity of this group. We predict that future environmental
	PCR studies will significantly augment known biodiversity that we
	have discovered and demonstrate the Cyanidiales to be a species-rich

  abstract = {Background: Proteins of various compositions are required by organisms
	inhabiting different environments. The energetic demands for protein
	formation are a function of the compositions of proteins as well
	as geochemical variables including temperature, pressure, oxygen
	fugacity and pH. The purpose of this study was to explore the dependence
	of metastable equilibrium states of protein systems on changes in
	the geochemical variables. Results: A software package called CHNOSZ
	implementing the revised Helgeson-Kirkham- Flowers (HKF) equations
	of state and group additivity for ionized unfolded aqueous proteins
	was developed. The program can be used to calculate standard molal
	Gibbs energies and other thermodynamic properties of reactions and
	to make chemical speciation and predominance diagrams that represent
	the metastable equilibrium distributions of proteins. The approach
	takes account of the chemical affinities of reactions in open systems
	characterized by the chemical potentials of basis species. The thermodynamic
	database included with the package permits application of the software
	to mineral and other inorganic systems as well as systems of proteins
	or other biomolecules. Conclusion: Metastable equilibrium activity
	diagrams were generated for model cell-surface proteins from archaea
	and bacteria adapted to growth in environments that differ in temperature
	and chemical conditions. The predicted metastable equilibrium distributions
	of the proteins can be compared with the optimal growth temperatures
	of the organisms and with geochemical variables. The results suggest
	that a thermodynamic assessment of protein metastability may be useful
	for integrating bio- and geochemical observations.},

  abstract = {Thermodynamic calculations can be used to quantify environmental constraints
	on the speciation of proteins, such as the pH and temperature dependence
	of ionization state, and the relative chemical stabilities of proteins
	in different biogeochemical settings. These calculations depend in
	part on values of the standard molal Gibbs energies of proteins and
	their ionization reactions as a function of temperature and pressure.
	Because these values are not generally available, we calculated values
	of the standard molal thermodynamic properties at 25 degrees C and
	1 bar as well as the revised Helgeson- Kirkham- Flowers equations
	of state parameters of neutral and charged zwitterionic reference
	model compounds including aqueous amino acids, polypeptides, and
	unfolded proteins. The experimental calorimetric and volumetric data
	for these species taken from the literature were combined with group
	additivity algorithms to calculate the properties and parameters
	of neutral and ionized sidechain and backbone groups in unfolded
	proteins. The resulting set of group contributions enables the calculation
	of the standard molal Gibbs energy, enthalpy, entropy, isobaric heat
	capacity, volume, and isothermal compressibility of unfolded proteins
	in a range of proton ionization states to temperatures and pressures
	exceeding 100 degrees C and 1000 bar. This approach provides a useful
	frame of reference for thermodynamic studies of protein folding and
	complexation reactions. It can also be used to assign provisional
	values of the net charge and Gibbs energy of ionized proteins as
	a function of temperature and pH. Using these values, an Eh-pH diagram
	for a reaction representing the speciation of extracellular proteins
	from Pyrococcus furiosus and Bacillus subtilis was generated. The
	predicted predominance limits of these proteins correspond with the
	different electrochemical conditions of hydrothermal vents and soils.
	More comprehensive calculations of this kind may reveal pervasive
	chemical potential constraints on the interactions of microbes with

	versus thermophilic Methanococcus with mesophilic versus thermophilic
	Bacillus revealed several pairs of amino acids for which one amino

	bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans and its thermophilic relative Thermus
	thermophilus, which are similar in G+C content. Of the 190 pairs
	of amino acids, 83 exhibited significant substitutional asymmetry,
	consistent with the pervasive effects of selection. Most of these
	significantly asymmetrical pairs of amino acids were asymmetrical
	in the direction predicted from the Methanococcus data, consistent
	with thermal adaptation resulting from universal biochemical properties
	of the amino acids. However, 12 pairs of amino acids exhibited asymmetry
	significantly different from and in the opposite direction of that
	found in the Methanococcus comparison, and 21 pairs of amino acids
	exhibited asymmetry that was significantly different from that found
	in the Bacillus comparison and could not be explained by the greater
	G+C content in thermophilic Bacillus. This suggests that selection
	due to universal biochemical properties of the amino acids and differences
	in G+C content are not the only causes of substitutional asymmetry
	between mesophiles and thermophiles. Instead, selection on taxon-specific

	‘‘Assembling the Tree of Life’’ project, we determined the

	5159 is a red-pigmented, rod-shaped, Gram-negative extreme thermophile
	isolated from a hot spring that possesses both an atypical cell wall
	composition and an unusual cell membrane that is composed entirely
	of long-chain 1,2- diols. Its genome is composed of two circular
	DNA elements, one of 2,006,217 bp (referred to as the chromosome)
	and one of 919,596 bp (referred to as the megaplasmid). Strikingly,
	though few standard housekeeping genes are found on the megaplasmid,
	it does encode a complete system for chemotaxis including both chemosensory
	components and an entire flagellar apparatus. This is the first known
	example of a complete flagellar system being encoded on a plasmid
	and suggests a straightforward means for lateral transfer of flagellum-based
	motility. Phylogenomic analyses support the recent rRNAbased analyses
	that led to T. roseum being removed from the phylum Thermomicrobia
	and assigned to the phylum Chloroflexi. Because T. roseum is a deep-branching
	member of this phylum, analysis of its genome provides insights into
	the evolution of the Chloroflexi. In addition, even though this species
	is not photosynthetic, analysis of the genome provides some insight
	into the origins of photosynthesis in the Chloroflexi. Metabolic
	pathway reconstructions and experimental studies revealed new aspects
	of the biology of this species. For example, we present evidence
	that T. roseum oxidizes CO aerobically, making it the first thermophile
	known to do so. In addition, we propose that glycosylation of its
	carotenoids plays a crucial role in the adaptation of the cell membrane
	to this bacterium’s thermophilic lifestyle. Analyses of published
	metagenomic sequences from two hot springs similar to the one from
	which this strain was isolated, show that close relatives of T. roseum
	DSM 5159 are present but have some key differences from the strain
