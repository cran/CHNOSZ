	revealed numerous genetically distinct 16S rRNA sequences from predominant
	Synechococcus populations distantly related to the readily cultivated
	unicellular cyanobacterium Synechococcus lividus. Patterns in genotype
	distribution relative to temperature and light conditions suggested
	that the organisms contributing these 16S rRNA sequences may fill
	distinct ecological niches. To test this hypothesis, Synechococcus
	isolates were cultivated using a dilution and filtration approach
	and then shown to be genetically relevant to natural mat populations
	by comparisons of similarities of 16S rRNA genes and 16S-23S internal
	transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Most isolates were identical or
	nearly identical at both loci to predominant mat genotypes; others
	showed 1- to 2-nucleotide differences at the 16S rRNA locus and even
	greater difference in ITS sequences. Isolates with predominant mat
	genotypes had distinct temperature ranges and optima for growth that
	were consistent with their distributions in the mat. Isolates with
	genotypes not previously detected or known to be predominant in the
	mat exhibited temperature ranges and optima that were not representative
	of predominant mat populations and also grew more slowly. Temperature
	effects on photosynthesis did not reflect temperature relations for
	growth. However, the isolate with the highest temperature optimum
	and upper limit was capable of performing photosynthesis at a higher
	temperature than other isolates. Growth rate and photosynthetic responses
	provided evidence for light acclimation but evidence of, at best,
	only subtle light adaptation.},

	diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring provided that major challenges
	in proteomics and related disciplines can be addressed. Plasma is
	not only the primary clinical specimen but also represents the largest
	and deepest version of the human proteome present in any sample:
	in addition to the classical "plasma proteins," it contains all tissue
	proteins (as leakage markers) plus very numerous distinct immunoglobulin
	sequences, and it has an extraordinary dynamic range in that more
	than 10 orders of magnitude in concentration separate albumin and
	the rarest proteins now measured clinically. Although the restricted
	dynamic range of conventional proteomic technology (two-dimensional
	gels and mass spectrometry) has limited its contribution to the list
	of 289 proteins (tabulated here) that have been reported in plasma
	to date, very recent advances in multidimensional survey techniques
	promise at least double this number in the near future. Abundant
	scientific evidence, from proteomics and other disciplines, suggests
	that among these are proteins whose abundances and structures change
	in ways indicative of many, if not most, human diseases. Nevertheless,
	only a handful of proteins are currently used in routine clinical
	diagnosis, and the rate of introduction of new protein tests approved
	by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has paradoxically
	declined over the last decade to less than one new protein diagnostic
	marker per year. We speculate on the reasons behind this large discrepancy
	between the expectations arising from proteomics and the realities
	of clinical diagnostics and suggest approaches by which protein-disease
	associations may be more effectively translated into diagnostic tools

  abstract = {Metagenomic studies characterize both the composition and diversity
	of uncultured viral and microbial communities. BLAST-based comparisons
	have typically been used for such analyses; however, sampling biases,
	high percentages of unknown sequences, and the use of arbitrary thresholds
	to find significant similarities can decrease the accuracy and validity
	of estimates. Here, we present Genome relative Abundance and Average
	Size (GAAS), a complete software package that provides improved estimates
	of community composition and average genome length for metagenomes
	in both textual and graphical formats. GAAS implements a novel methodology
	to control for sampling bias via length normalization, to adjust
	for multiple BLAST similarities by similarity weighting, and to select
	significant similarities using relative alignment lengths. In benchmark
	tests, the GAAS method was robust to both high percentages of unknown
	sequences and to variations in metagenomic sequence read lengths.
	Re-analysis of the Sargasso Sea virome using GAAS indicated that
	standard methodologies for metagenomic analysis may dramatically
	underestimate the abundance and importance of organisms with small
	genomes in environmental systems. Using GAAS, we conducted a meta-analysis
	of microbial and viral average genome lengths in over 150 metagenomes
	from four biomes to determine whether genome lengths vary consistently
	between and within biomes, and between microbial and viral communities
	from the same environment. Significant differences between biomes
	and within aquatic sub-biomes (oceans, hypersaline systems, freshwater,
	and microbialites) suggested that average genome length is a fundamental
	property of environments driven by factors at the sub-biome level.
	The behavior of paired viral and microbial metagenomes from the same
	environment indicated that microbial and viral average genome sizes
	are independent of each other, but indicative of community responses
	to stressors and environmental conditions.},

	Cyanidiales, their population structure and their phylogenetic relationships.
	Here we used a taxonomically broadly sampled three-gene data set

	a novel monophyletic lineage of mesophilic Cyanidium spp. and the
	Cyanidioschyzon merolae plus Galdieria maxima lineage. Our analyses
	do not support the notion of a mesophilic ancestry of the Cyanidiales
	and suggest that these algae were ancestrally thermo-acidotolerant.
	We also used environmental polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the
	rbcL gene to sample Cyanidiales biodiversity at five ecologically
	distinct sites at Pisciarelli in the Phlegrean Fields in Italy. This
	analysis showed a high level of sequence divergence among Cyanidiales
	species and the partitioning of taxa based on environmental conditions.
	Our research revealed an unexpected level of genetic diversity among
	Cyanidiales that revises current thinking about the phylogeny and
	biodiversity of this group. We predict that future environmental

	have discovered and demonstrate the Cyanidiales to be a species-rich

	was developed. The program can be used to calculate standard molal
	Gibbs energies and other thermodynamic properties of reactions and

	An analysis of the carotenoid components revealed that isolates MD-66(T)

  abstract = {Background: Knowledge about the abundance of molecular components
	is an important prerequisite for building quantitative predictive
	models of cellular behavior. Proteins are central components of these
	models, since they carry out most of the fundamental processes in
	the cell. Thus far, protein concentrations have been difficult to
	measure on a large scale, but proteomic technologies have now advanced
	to a stage where this information becomes readily accessible. Results:
	Here, we describe an experimental scheme to maximize the coverage
	of proteins identified by mass spectrometry of a complex biological
	sample. Using a combination of LC-MS/MS approaches with protein and
	peptide fractionation steps we identified 1103 proteins from the
	cytosolic fraction of the Escherichia coli strain MC4100. A measure
	of abundance is presented for each of the identified proteins, based
	on the recently developed emPAI approach which takes into account
	the number of sequenced peptides per protein. The values of abundance
	are within a broad range and accurately reflect independently measured
	copy numbers per cell. As expected, the most abundant proteins were
	those involved in protein synthesis, most notably ribosomal proteins.
	Proteins involved in energy metabolism as well as those with binding
	function were also found in high copy number while proteins annotated
	with the terms metabolism, transcription, transport, and cellular
	organization were rare. The barrel-sandwich fold was found to be
	the structural fold with the highest abundance. Highly abundant proteins
	are predicted to be less prone to aggregation based on their length,
	pI values, and occurrence patterns of hydrophobic stretches. We also
	find that abundant proteins tend to be predominantly essential. Additionally
	we observe a significant correlation between protein and mRNA abundance
	in E. coli cells. Conclusion: Abundance measurements for more than
	1000 E. coli proteins presented in this work represent the most complete
	study of protein abundance in a bacterial cell so far. We show significant
	associations between the abundance of a protein and its properties
	and functions in the cell. In this way, we provide both data and
	novel insights into the role of protein concentration in this model

  abstract = {Asymmetrical patterns of amino acid substitution in proteins of organisms
	living at moderate and high temperatures (mesophiles and thermophiles,
	respectively) are generally taken to indicate selection favoring
	different amino acids at different temperatures due to their biochemical
	properties. If that were the case, comparisons of different pairs
	of mesophilic and thennophilic taxa would exhibit similar patterns
	of substitutional asymmetry. A previous comparison of mesophilic
	versus thermophilic Methanococcus with mesophilic versus thermophilic
	Bacillus revealed several pairs of amino acids for which one amino
	acid was favored in thermophilic Bacillus and the other was favored
	in thermophilic Methanococcus. Most of this could be explained by
	the higher G+C content of the DNA of thermophilic Bacillus, a phenomenon
	not seen in the Methanococcus comparison. Here, I compared the mesophilic
	bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans and its thermophilic relative Thermus
	thermophilus, which are similar in G+C content. Of the 190 pairs
	of amino acids, 83 exhibited significant substitutional asymmetry,
	consistent with the pervasive effects of selection. Most of these
	significantly asymmetrical pairs of amino acids were asymmetrical
	in the direction predicted from the Methanococcus data, consistent
	with thermal adaptation resulting from universal biochemical properties
	of the amino acids. However, 12 pairs of amino acids exhibited asymmetry
	significantly different from and in the opposite direction of that
	found in the Methanococcus comparison, and 21 pairs of amino acids
	exhibited asymmetry that was significantly different from that found
	in the Bacillus comparison and could not be explained by the greater
	G+C content in thermophilic Bacillus. This suggests that selection
	due to universal biochemical properties of the amino acids and differences
	in G+C content are not the only causes of substitutional asymmetry
	between mesophiles and thermophiles. Instead, selection on taxon-specific
	properties of amino acids, such as their metabolic cost, may play
	a role in causing asymmetrical patterns of substitution.},

	at all three locations is dominated by members of the Aquificales

	that the knallgas reaction is just one of many exergonic reactions
	in the Yellowstone hot springs, that energy-yields for certain reactions
	can vary substantially from one site to the next, and that few of

	These calculations involve quantifying the chemical affinity for

	compositions of mixtures in which oxidation-reduction reactions are
	inhibited. The oxidation-reduction reactions that depart from equilibrium
	in these systems provide energy for chemotrophic microbial metabolism.
	Methanogenesis is an example of this phenomenon, in which the combination
	of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and methane induced by fluid mixing is
	far from equilibrium, which can be approached if more methane is
	generated. Similarly, the production of other organic compounds is
	also favorable under the same conditions that permit methanogenesis.
	Alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, aldehydes, carboxylic acids and amino
	acids are among the compounds that, if formed, would lower the energetic
	state of the chemical composition generated in mixed fluids. The
	resulting positive values of chemical affinity correspond to the
	thermodynamic drive required for abiotic organic synthesis. It is

	5159 is a red-pigmented, rod-shaped, Gram-negative extreme thermophile
	isolated from a hot spring that possesses both an atypical cell wall
	composition and an unusual cell membrane that is composed entirely
	of long-chain 1,2- diols. Its genome is composed of two circular
	DNA elements, one of 2,006,217 bp (referred to as the chromosome)
	and one of 919,596 bp (referred to as the megaplasmid). Strikingly,
	though few standard housekeeping genes are found on the megaplasmid,
	it does encode a complete system for chemotaxis including both chemosensory
	components and an entire flagellar apparatus. This is the first known
	example of a complete flagellar system being encoded on a plasmid
	and suggests a straightforward means for lateral transfer of flagellum-based
	motility. Phylogenomic analyses support the recent rRNAbased analyses
