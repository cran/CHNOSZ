Description: Functions and data sets to support chemical thermodynamic modeling in biochemistry
  and low-temperature geochemistry. The features include calculation of the standard molal
  thermodynamic properties and chemical affinities of reactions involving minerals and/or
  biomolecules; a database of thermodynamic properties of aqueous, crystalline and gaseous
  species; amino acid group additivity for the standard molal thermodynamic properties of
  neutral and ionized proteins; use of the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations of state
  for aqueous species; construction of equilibrium activity diagrams as a function of
  temperature, pressure, and chemical activities or fugacities of basis species.
