Description: An integrated set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in geochemistry and
  compositional biology. Thermodynamic properties are taken from a database for minerals
  and inorganic and organic aqueous species including biomolecules, or from amino acid
  group additivity for proteins. High-temperature properties are calculated using the
  revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations of state for aqueous species, and activity
  coefficients can be calculated for specified ionic strength. Functions are
  provided to define a system using basis species, automatically balance reactions,
  calculate the chemical affinities of formation reactions for selected species, calculate
  equilibrium activities, and plot the results on chemical activity diagrams.
