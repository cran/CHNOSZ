Description: This package includes functions and data sets to support chemical thermodynamic 
  modeling in biochemistry and low-temperature geochemistry. The features include calculation
  of the standard molal thermodynamic properties and chemical affinities of reactions involving 
  minerals and/or biomolecules; a database of thermodynamic properties of aqueous, crystalline 
  and gaseous species; amino acid group additivity for the standard molal thermodynamic 
  properties of neutral and ionized proteins; use of the revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers 
  equations of state for aqueous species; construction of equilibrium activity diagrams as a
  function of temperature, pressure, and chemical activities or fugacities of basis species.
