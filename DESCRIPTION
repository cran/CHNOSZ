Description: An integrated set of tools for thermodynamic calculations in compositional
  biology and geochemistry. Thermodynamic properties are taken from a database for minerals
  and inorganic and organic aqueous species including biomolecules, or from amino acid
  group additivity for proteins. High-temperature properties are calculated using the
  revised Helgeson-Kirkham-Flowers equations of state for aqueous species. Functions are
  provided to define a system using basis species, automatically balance reactions,
  calculate the chemical affinities of reactions for selected species, and plot the results
  on potential diagrams or equilibrium activity diagrams. Experimental features are
  available to calculate activity coefficients for aqueous species or for multidimensional
  optimization of thermodynamic variables using an objective function.
